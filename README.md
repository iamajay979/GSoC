Software button debouncing project with [apertus°](https://www.apertus.org/) Association

The main idea of the project is to design a button debouncing software based system for the apertusº AXIOM Remote, the remote control unit of the AXIOM Beta Camera system.

The code should accomplish:
· Effficiency
. Be Comprehensible


To reach the wanted code I have written different codes first, to get all the knowledge and the necessary practice to make the final code.
This codes are uploaded on this GitHub to be able of follow all the steps and to understand everything from a low level.

We used some of the codes provided [here](http://vserver.13thfloor.at/Stuff/AXIOM/REMOTE/)
Those are: [icsp_ser.c](http://vserver.13thfloor.at/Stuff/AXIOM/REMOTE/icsp_ser.c/)
           [ser_dbg.c](http://vserver.13thfloor.at/Stuff/AXIOM/REMOTE/ser_dbg.c/)
           [ser_icsp6_prog.c](http://vserver.13thfloor.at/Stuff/AXIOM/REMOTE/ser_icsp6_prog.c/)
